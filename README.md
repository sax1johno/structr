# What is Structr?

Structr is the world's most advanced graph application platform. A powerful toolkit that uses the benefits of a graph database and allows building even complex software applications in much less time and effort than traditional development techniques.

In addition to the benefits of graph technology itself, Structr provides unprecedented speed and flexibility in application development. Any structure and content can be modified through a graphical user interface. Changes take effect immediately without costly compilation or deployment.

The secret is that the entire definition of the application - from the data model to the business logic to the user interface - is modeled as a coherent graph and stored in a graph database. This allows to render markup and content in real-time directly from the graph and develop an application in a truly agile way, giving direct influence on the results at any time to power users and decision makers.
